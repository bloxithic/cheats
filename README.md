## 📖 How to Use

### ✅ Bookmark Method (Recommended)

* Create a new bookmark in your browser
* Edit the bookmark and paste your script into the URL field like this:

```js
javascript:(function(){/* your script code here */})();
```

* Click the bookmark to execute it

---

### ⚠️ Address Bar Method (Not Recommended)
