📖 **How to Use Scripts**

✅ **Bookmark Method (Recommended)**
**1.** Create a new bookmark in your browser

**2.** Edit the bookmark and paste your script into the URL field like this:

javascript:(function(){/* your script code here */})();

**3.** Go to the website you want to run the script on

**4.** Click the bookmark to execute it

⚠️ **Address Bar Method (Not Recommended)**
**1.** Paste your script in the address bar:

javascript:(function(){/* your script code here */})();

- Most browsers block javascript: URLs — you might need to type javascript: manually if it’s removed automatically

🧪 **Browser Console Method**
**1.** Right-click the webpage and choose “Inspect” or press F12

**2.** Go to the Console tab

**3.** Paste the script directly into the console and press Enter

🧷 **Userscript Manager (e.g. Tampermonkey)**

**1.** Install a userscript manager like Tampermonkey: https://www.tampermonkey.net/

**2.** Create a new script and paste your code inside the editor

**3.** Save and enable the script — it will run automatically on matching pages
